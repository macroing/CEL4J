/**
 * An {@code AbstractReflectiveNodeHierarchicalVisitor} is used for traversing the structure of a {@link Node} in a hierarchical fashion. 
 * <p>
 * This abstract class delegates method calls for {@code visitEnter(Node)} and {@code visitLeave(Node)} to overloaded methods with the same name.
 * <p>
 * The delegation is completely driven by the Java Reflection API. This means that you can create a subclass containing any number of overloaded methods, provided that it has exactly one parameter argument and that parameter argument is assignment
 * compatible to the interface {@code Node}.
 * <p>
 * The names of the overloaded methods must be either {@code visitEnter} or {@code visitLeave}.
 * <p>
 * The return type does not matter. But if being able to skip entering child or sibling {@code Node}s are important, the return type has to be either {@code Boolean} or {@code boolean} and the returned value has to be either {@code Boolean.FALSE} or
 * {@code false}. Any other return type and returned value will be interpreted as {@code boolean} and {@code true}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * Any access modifier may be used, so private methods are allowed.
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0
