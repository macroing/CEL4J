CEL4J Java Decompiler:

	* CHANGE:		Fix duplicate methods when overriding a generic method. For example the methods compareTo(Object) and compareTo(Person) in the Person class. The compareTo(Person) method does not have an @Override annotation either, because of different method signatures.
	* CHANGE:		Change the extends clause of inner classes. Currently it may look like extends JComponent$AccessibleJComponent.
	* CHANGE:		Take the generic type name into account when sorting methods and other members of classes. Currently they are sorted as if they were Object or some other type.
	* REMOVE:		Remove synthetic fields from classes.
